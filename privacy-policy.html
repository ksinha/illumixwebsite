                    <h3>Personal Data We Receive Automatically When You Use the Sites:</h3>
                    <p>When you visit, use and interact with the Sites, we may receive certain information about your

                        come from (e.g., google.com, yahoo.com, etc.), and which browsers people use to access and visit

                    <p><strong>Log data:</strong> Information that your browser automatically sends whenever you visit
                        the Sites ("log data"). Log data includes your IP address (so we understand which country you

                    <p>We may, and we may allow third party service providers to, use cookies or other tracking
                        technologies to collect information about your browsing activities over time and across

                        signal is received. If we do respond to DNT signals in the future, we will describe how we do so
                        in this Privacy Policy.</p>

                    <h3>Marketing:</h3>
                    <p>We may contact you to provide information we believe will be of interest to you. For instance, if
                        you elect to provide your email address, we may use that information to send you promotional
                        information about our products and services (such as to let you know that a game you are
                        interested in is available for download). If we do, where required by law, for example if you
                        are in the EU, we will only send you such emails if you consent to us doing so at the time you
                        provide us with your Personal Data. You may opt out of receiving emails by following the
                        instructions contained in each promotional email we send you or by contacting us. If you
                        unsubscribe from our marketing lists, you will no longer receive marketing communications, but
                        we will continue to contact you regarding our Sites and Services and to respond to your

                    <h2>HOW WE SHARE AND DISCLOSE PERSONAL DATA</h2>

                    <p>In certain circumstances we may share your Personal Data with certain categories of third parties

                    <h3>Vendors and Service Providers:</h3>
                    <p>To assist us in meeting business operations needs and to perform certain services and functions,
                        we may share Personal Data with service providers, including hosting providers; email

                        development platforms; payment processors; and analytics services. Pursuant to our instructions,

                        duties to us.</p>

                    <h3>Business Transfers:</h3>

                        receivership, sale of all or a portion of our assets, or transition of service to another
                        provider, your Personal Data and other information may be shared in the diligence process with
                        counterparties and others assisting with the transaction and transferred to a successor or
                        affiliate as part of that transaction along with other assets.</p>

                    <h3>Legal Requirements:</h3>
                    <p>If required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i)
                        comply with legal or regulatory obligations, including to respond to lawful requests from public
                        authorities and to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, (ii) protect and
                        defend our rights or property, (iii) prevent fraud, (iv) act in urgent circumstances to protect
                        the personal safety of users of the Sites, or the public, or (v) protect against legal
                        liability.</p>

                    <h2>DATA RETENTION</h2>

                    <p>We keep Personal Data for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes described in this
                        Privacy Policy, while we have a legitimate business need to do so, or as required by law (e.g.
                        for tax, legal, accounting or other purposes), whichever is the longer.</p>

                    <p>If you have elected to receive marketing communications from us, we retain information about your
                        marketing preferences until you opt out of receiving these communications and in accordance with
                        our policies.</p>

                    <p>To determine the appropriate retention period for your Personal Data, we will consider the
                        amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from
                        unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Data, the purposes for which we use your
                        Personal Data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable
                        legal requirements.</p>

                    <h2>UPDATE YOUR INFORMATION</h2>

                    <p>If you need to change or correct your Personal Data, or wish to have it deleted from our systems,
                        you may contact us at privacy@illumix.com. We will address your request as required by

                    <h2>CHILDREN</h2>

                    <p>Our Service is not directed to children. Illumix does not knowingly collect Personal Data from
                        children. If you have reason to believe that a child has provided Personal Data to Illumix
                        through the Service please contact us and we will endeavor to delete that information from our
                        databases. We consider children to be anyone younger than 16.</p>

                    <h2>EU USERS</h2>

                    <h3>Scope:</h3>

                        <li><strong>Right of access:</strong> If you ask us, we will confirm whether we are processing
                            your Personal Data and, if so, provide you with a copy of that Personal Data along with

                            possible and lawful to do so, we will also tell you with whom we shared your Personal Data

                            so, we will also tell you with whom we shared your Personal Data with so you can contact
                            them directly.</li>
                        <li><strong>Right to restrict processing:</strong> You may ask us to restrict or 'block' the
                            processing of your Personal Data in certain circumstances, such as where you contest the

                            possible. If you ask us, and where possible and lawful to do so, we will also tell you with
                            whom we shared your Personal Data so you can contact them directly.</li>

                            from us that you consented to give us or that was provided to us as necessary in connection
                            with our contract with you, and that is processed by automated means. We will give you your

                            elsewhere.</li>
                        <li><strong>Right to object:</strong> You may ask us at any time to stop processing your
                            Personal Data, and we will do so:
                            <ul>
                                <li>If we are relying on a legitimate interest to process your Personal Data — unless we
                                    demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing or we need to process
                                    your data in order to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims;</li>

                                    above);</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Right to withdraw consent:</strong> If we rely on your consent to process your
                            Personal Data, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal of
                            consent will not affect any processing of your data before we received notice that you
                            wished to withdraw consent.</li>
                        <li><strong>Right to lodge a complaint with the data protection authority:</strong> If you have
                            a concern about our privacy practices, including the way we handled your Personal Data, you
                            can report it to the data protection authority that is authorized to hear those concerns (in
