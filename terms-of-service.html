                    <p>The Sites are hosted in the United States. We make no claims concerning whether the Content may
                        be downloaded, viewed, or be appropriate for use outside of the United States. If you access the

                        the laws of your specific jurisdiction.</p>

                        with such restrictions and not to export or re-export any of the Content to countries or persons
                        prohibited under the export control laws. By downloading the Content, you are expressly agreeing
                        that you are not in a country where such export is prohibited or are a person or entity for

                        specific jurisdiction regarding the import, export, or re-export of the Content.</p>

                    <h3>Member Account, Password and Security:</h3>
                    <p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account, if any, and

                        any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each
                        session when accessing the Service. Illumix will not be liable for any loss or damage arising
                        from your failure to comply with this Section.</p>

                    <p>You acknowledge that Illumix may establish general practices and limits concerning use of the
                        Service, including without limitation the maximum period of time that data or other content will

                        content. You acknowledge that Illumix does not pre-screen content, but that Illumix and its
                        designees will have the right (but not the obligation) in their sole discretion to refuse or
                        remove any content that is available via the Service. Without limiting the foregoing, Illumix
                        and its designees will have the right to remove any content that violates these Terms of Use or
                        is deemed by Illumix, in its sole discretion, to be otherwise objectionable. You agree that you

                        reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of such content.</p>

                    <h3>User Content Transmitted Through the Service:</h3>
                    <p>With respect to the content or other materials you upload through the Service or share with other

                        free, fully paid up, transferable, sublicensable, perpetual, irrevocable license to copy,

                        marketing thereof, in any form, medium or technology now known or later developed.</p>

                    <p>You acknowledge and agree that any questions, comments, suggestions, ideas, feedback or other
                        information about the Service (" Submissions"), provided by you to Illumix are non-confidential

                    <p>You acknowledge and agree that Illumix may preserve content and may also disclose content if
                        required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such preservation or disclosure is
                        reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process, applicable laws or government requests;
                        (b) enforce these Terms of Use; (c) respond to claims that any content violates the rights of
                        third parties; or (d) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Illumix, its users and
                        the public. You understand that the technical processing and transmission of the Service,
                        including your content, may involve (a) transmissions over various networks; and (b) changes to
                        conform and adapt to technical requirements of connecting networks or devices.</p>

                    <h3>Copyright Complaints:</h3>
                    <p>Illumix respects the intellectual property of others, and we ask our users to do the same. If you
                        believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, or that
                        your intellectual property rights have been otherwise violated, you should notify Illumix of
                        your infringement claim in accordance with the procedure set forth below.</p>

                        actions under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (" DMCA") and other applicable intellectual
                        property laws with respect to any alleged or actual infringement. A notification of claimed
                        copyright infringement should be e-mailed to Illumix's Copyright Agent at legal@illumix.com
                        (Subject line: "DMCA Takedown Request").</p>

                    <h3>Counter-Notice:</h3>
                    <p>If you believe that your User Content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not
                        infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's
                        agent, or pursuant to the law, to upload and use the content in your User Content, you may send

                            result of mistake or a misidentification of the content; and</li>
                        <li>your name, address, telephone number, and email address, a statement that you consent to the
                            jurisdiction of the federal court located within Northern District of California and a
                            statement that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification
                            of the alleged infringement.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>If a counter-notice is received by the Copyright Agent, Illumix will send a copy of the

                        may be replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of

                    <h3>Virtual Money and Virtual Goods:</h3>
                    <p>Certain Services and/or Apps permit the purchase of virtual currency ("Virtual Money") and use of
                        that Virtual Money to purchase virtual items or services expressly available for use in the
                        respective Apps ("Virtual Goods"). Virtual Money is a category of Service Content (as defined
                        below). You may access and purchase Virtual Goods for your personal, non-commercial use of the
                        Services. You acknowledge that you do not acquire any ownership rights in or to the Virtual
                        Money or Virtual Goods. Any balance of Virtual Goods or Virtual Money does not reflect any
                        stored value and you agree that Virtual Money and Virtual Goods have no monetary value and do
                        not constitute currency or property of any type. Virtual Money may be redeemed only for Virtual
                        Goods and can never be sold, transferred, or exchanged for "real" money, "real" goods, or "real"
                        services from us or anyone else. You agree that you will only obtain Virtual Money and/or
                        Virtual Goods from us and through means provided by us, and not from any third party unless
                        expressly authorized. Once you acquire a license to Virtual Money or Virtual Goods, you may not
                        transfer them to another individual or account. Any such sale, transfer, or exchange (or attempt
                        to do so) is prohibited, is a violation of these Terms and may result in cancellation of such
                        Virtual Money or Virtual Goods or the termination of your Account.</p>

                    <p>During the term of your license to your Virtual Money, you may redeem your Virtual Money for
                        selected Virtual Goods. As set forth below, all Virtual Money, Virtual Goods, and other Content
                        is provided "as is," without any warranty. You agree that all sales by us to you of Virtual
                        Money and Virtual Goods are final and that we will not permit exchanges or refunds for any
                        unused Virtual Money or Virtual Goods once the transaction has been made.</p>

                    <p>Generally, we have the right to offer, modify, eliminate, and/or terminate Virtual Money, Virtual
                        Goods, the Content, and/or the Services, or any portion thereof, at any time, without notice or
                        liability to you. If we discontinue the use of Virtual Money or Virtual Goods, we will provide
                        at least 60 days advance notice to you by posting a notice through the Services or through other
                        communications.</p>

                        employees, directors and agents (collectively, " Indemnitees") harmless from any from any and
                        all losses, damages, expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, rights, claims, actions of
                        any kind and injury (including death) arising out of or relating to your use of the Service, any
                        User Content, your connection to the Service, your violation of these Terms of Use or your
                        violation of any rights of another. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you will have no obligation

                        California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: "A general
                        release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his
                        favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected
                        his settlement with the debtor." If you are a resident of another jurisdiction, you waive any
                        comparable statute or doctrine.</p>

                    <h3>Agreement to Arbitrate</h3>
                    <p>This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section is referred to in these Terms of Use as
                        the "Arbitration Agreement." You agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or
                        may arise between you and Illumix, whether arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use
                        (including any alleged breach thereof), the Services, any advertising, any aspect of the
                        relationship or transactions between us, shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding
                        arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement,
                        except that you may assert individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify.
                        Further, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention
                        of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief
                        against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into these Terms of Use, you and Illumix
                        are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Your rights
                        will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury. The Federal Arbitration Act
                        governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.</p>

                    <h3>Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief</h3>
                    <p><strong>YOU AND ILLUMIX AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN
                            INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR
                            REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND ILLUMIX AGREE OTHERWISE, THE
                            ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT
                            OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING.
                            ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY
                            RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT
                            NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S), EXCEPT THAT
                            YOU MAY PURSUE A CLAIM FOR AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF UNDER
                            APPLICABLE LAW TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED FOR THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS PROVISION.</strong></p>

                    <h3>Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution</h3>
                    <p>Illumix is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most customer
                        concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer's satisfaction by emailing customer support
                        at support@illumix.com. If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek
                        arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute
                        ("Notice"). The Notice to Illumix should be sent to [Address] ("Notice Address"). The Notice
                        must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific
                        relief sought. If Illumix and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after
                        the Notice is received, you or Illumix may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the
                        arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Illumix or you shall not be disclosed to
                        the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Illumix
                        is entitled.</p>

                    <h3>Arbitration Procedures</h3>
                    <p>Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration
                        Association's (" AAA") rules and procedures, including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules
                        (collectively, the "AAA Rules"), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For information on
                        the AAA, please visit its website, <a href="http://www.adr.org">http://www.adr.org</a>.
                        Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA's
                        consumer arbitration page, <a
                            href="http://www.adr.org/consumer_arbitration">http://www.adr.org/consumer_arbitration</a>.
                        If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration
                        Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator
                        determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result
                        in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these
                        Terms of Use as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not
                        limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration
                        Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials
                        and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an
                        individual basis that a court can award to an individual under the Terms of Use and applicable
                        law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only
                        for very limited reasons.</p>

                    <p>Unless Illumix and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably
                        convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other
                        pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination
                        shall be made by AAA. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, Illumix agrees that you may choose
                        whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the
                        arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA
                        Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA
                        Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall
                        issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions
                        on which the award is based.</p>

                    <h3>Costs of Arbitration</h3>
                    <p>Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the " Arbitration
                        Fees") will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration
                        Agreement. If the value of the relief sought is $75,000 or less, at your request, Illumix will
                        pay all Arbitration Fees. If the value of relief sought is more than $75,000 and you are able to
                        demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of the
                        Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be
                        required to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees, Illumix will pay your portion of such
                        fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be
                        prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Illumix will pay as much of the Arbitration
                        Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive.
                        Any payment of attorneys' fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.</p>

                    <h3>Confidentiality</h3>
                    <p>All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator,
                        will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.</p>

                    <h3>Severability</h3>
                    <p>If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement
                        (other than the subsection (b) titled "Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and
                        Non-Individualized Relief" above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such
                        term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest
                        to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this
                        Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides
                        that any of the provisions of subsection (b) above titled "Prohibition of Class and
                        Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief" are invalid or unenforceable, then the
                        entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, unless such provisions are deemed
                        to be invalid or unenforceable solely with respect to claims for public injunctive relief. The
                        remainder of the Terms of Use will continue to apply.</p>

                    <h3>Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement</h3>
                    <p>Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms of Use to the contrary, Illumix agrees that if it
                        makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice
                        Address) while you are a user of the Services, you may reject any such change by sending Illumix
                        written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice Address provided
                        above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute
                        between us in accordance with the language of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you
                        first accepted these Terms of Use (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms of Use).
                    </p>

                    <h2>Suspension and Termination</h2>

                    <p>Although Illumix is not obligated to monitor access to or use of the Services, Apps, or Service
                        Content or to review or edit any Service Content, we have the right to do so for the purpose of
                        operating the Services and Apps, to ensure compliance with these Terms of Use, and to comply
                        with applicable law or other legal requirements. You agree that Illumix, in its sole discretion,
                        may suspend or terminate your account (or any part thereof) or use of the Service and remove and
                        discard any content within the Service, for any reason, including, without limitation, for lack
                        of use or if Illumix believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or
                        spirit of these Terms of Use. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive or illegal activity that may be
                        grounds for termination of your use of Service, may be referred to appropriate law enforcement
                        authorities. Illumix may also, in its sole discretion and at any time, discontinue providing the
                        Service, or any part thereof, with or without notice. You agree that any termination of your
                        access to the Service under any provision of these Terms of Use may be effected without prior
                        notice, and acknowledge and agree that Illumix may immediately deactivate or delete your account
                        and all related information and files in your account and/or bar any further access to such
                        files or the Service. Further, you agree that Illumix will not be liable to you or any third
                        party for any termination of your access to the Service.</p>

                    <h2>User Disputes</h2>

                    <p>You agree that you are solely responsible for your interactions with any other user in connection
                        with the Service and Illumix will have no liability or responsibility with respect thereto.
                        Illumix reserves the right, but has no obligation, to become involved in any way with disputes
                        between you and any other user of the Service.</p>

                    <h2>General</h2>

                    <p>These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and Illumix and govern your use of
                        the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Illumix with respect to the
                        Service. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use
                        affiliate or third party services, third party content or third party software. These Terms of
                        Use will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
                        law provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as set forth
                        above, you and Illumix agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state
                        and federal courts located within San Mateo County, California. The failure of Illumix to
                        exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use will not constitute a waiver of
                        such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent
                        jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to
                        give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions
                        of these Terms of Use remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute
                        or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the
                        Service or these Terms of Use must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of
                        action arose or be forever barred. A printed version of this agreement and of any notice given
                        in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or
                        relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other
                        business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. You may not
                        assign these Terms of Use without the prior written consent of Illumix, but Illumix may assign
                        or transfer these Terms of Use, in whole or in part, without restriction. The section titles in
                        these Terms of Use are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Notices to
                        you may be made via either email or regular mail. The Service may also provide notices to you of
                        changes to these Terms of Use or other matters by displaying notices or links to notices
                        generally on the Service.</p>
